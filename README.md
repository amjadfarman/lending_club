# Lending Club -- Which loans will be paid back?

Lending Club is a company that operates in the USA and facilitates peer to peer loans.
The lenders can invest their money to fund the loans and in return they earn profit from the interests paid by the borrowers.
The investers can choose to invest in one of the five categories; A, B, C, D, and E.
The investment strategy A yields the minimum returns but also involves a minimum risk while the investment strategy E yields maximum returns but involves the highest risk that loan will not be paid back.
